# RetroGaming ðŸ‘¾

## What is it?

RetroGaming works like an old arcade. You can play games like *Snake* or *Pacman*!
It works with a plug-in system: you can load and unload dynamic libraries (.so files on *Linux*).
So you have to directories:
- ****games**** -> Stores game files.
- **libs** -> Stores graphical librairy files.

When you launch the executable file you'll have a menu. From this menu you can choose a game and the graphical librairy to be used and then launch the game.

    git clone git@github.com:lgrante/RetroGaming.git
